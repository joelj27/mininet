# mininet
Mininet is a network emulator which creates a network of virtual hosts, switches, controllers, and links.<br />
Mininet hosts run standard Linux network software, and its switches support OpenFlow for highly flexible custom routing and Software-Defined Networking.<br />

multicontroller architecture is a set of controllers working together to achieve some level of performance and scalability.<br />

software emulator for prototyping a large network on a single machine. ... Mininet allows the user to quickly create, interact with, customize and share a software-defined network (SDN) prototype to simulate a network topology that uses Openï¬‚ow switches.<br />




multicontroller sdn network  simulation is done with python and mininet <br />
1.clients were created <br />
2.ovskernel swithchs were cerated to establish connection between the clients<br />
3.Three local controller were created<br />
3.RYU controller were cerated to make link between all the local controller  to make a network.<br />

TO execute : Run main.py<br />
